# Humana-Mays Case Competition 2024
## Project Overview
This project aims to address the low engagement rates in preventive care visits among Humanaâ€™s Medicare Advantage Local Preferred Provider Organization (LPPO) members. Despite offering flexibility in specialist access, LPPO plans experience significantly higher disengagement compared to HMO plans, which adversely impacts health outcomes, Medicare Stars ratings, and financial performance.

Through predictive modeling and business research, we provide data-driven strategies to increase member engagement, enhance financial performance, and improve health outcomes.

## Key Objectives
Identify Key Drivers of Disengagement
Utilize machine learning models to analyze demographic, healthcare utilization, and claims data to uncover factors contributing to low engagement in preventive care visits.

Develop Predictive Models
Create a predictive model to identify LPPO members at high risk of disengagement, enabling targeted interventions.

Propose Actionable Strategies
Recommend practical solutions, including financial assistance programs, expanded virtual care options, and member support systems, to enhance engagement rates and health outcomes.

## Methodology
### Data Preparation
Datasets:
Training dataset: 1,527,904 members  
Holdout dataset: 381,976 members  
Data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformations included creating new variables (e.g., cost trends, pharmacy utilization, engagement indicators).  
### Model Development 
Model Used: LightGBM  
Optimization Techniques: Bayesian Optimization and Randomized Search  
Performance Metrics:  
AUC-ROC: 0.7536  
Precision-Recall AUC: 0.7321  
## Results
1. Identified key drivers of disengagement, such as financial burden, lack of preventive care engagement, and insufficient digital interaction.  
2. Proposed strategies to reduce disengagement through deductible reductions, virtual care expansion, and structured support groups.  
3. Achieved measurable outcomes in member engagement, with proposed interventions projected to improve engagement by 20% and reduce financial barriers by 25%.  
## Key Achievements
1. Advanced to Round 2: Top 50 teams.  
2. Successfully used predictive modeling and business strategies to address a critical healthcare engagement issue. 
## Recommendations
1. Reduce financial strain with deductible reductions and partial co-insurance waivers.  
2. Expand virtual care options to provide accessible preventive care.  
3. Strengthen member support systems with personalized AI-driven tools and community engagement initiatives.
